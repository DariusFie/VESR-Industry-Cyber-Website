    </header>

    <main>
      <h2>Honesty</h2>
      <p>Honesty is very important to me because not only does it build trust, but it also creates clarity and reflects your beliefs and values. It shows courage and accountability; when you're honest with yourself and the people around you, it can take you very far in life. All in all, it represents growth and strengthens connections.</p>
      <p>I developed this value because I myself have those moments when I'm not being honest with myself and denying things around me, knowing deep down I should be giving myself those hard truths, because it builds character and enhances my mental state.</p>

      <h2>Compassion</h2>
      <p>Compassion is a value to me because showing empathy and kindness to others is essential. The goal is not only to always treat people the way I want to be treated but also to understand and support people no matter who they are or how they look. And with that, compassion comes into play tremendously.</p>
      <p>I developed this value because in this day and age, lots of negativity goes on in the world, so showing compassion no matter the situation can bring light to a person or people in general. It's all about being kind and seeing things in a better light.</p>

      <h2>Growth</h2>
      <p>Growth is one of my biggest and most important values because I value learning, evolving, and pushing myself to be better every day. Whether it's learning from school or learning more about myself and how I am, it's all important. Not only that, but growth can also give you a boost in mood and energy.</p>
      <p>I developed this value because, being a college student, I know that personal development is a lifelong journey. When aging and growing in general, growth will always be needed, especially when it comes to knowing yourself and character development.</p>
