      <h1>Healthcare Industry</h1>

    <h2>Industry Overview</h2>
    <p>The industry our business is set in would be the healthcare industry, which focuses on providing medical services and manufacturing medical equipment. Our purpose is to ensure patients are getting the guaranteed help they need with the best working technology.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>I work as a Quality Manager, responsible for testing equipment and keeping everything working and updated. The tools I use for this role are dual monitors, mobile devices like tablets and smartphones, high-performance laptops and desktops, networking tech such as routers, switches, and access points, barcode scanners, storage (USB, SSD), etc.</p>

    <h2>Ethical Issue</h2>
    <p>One ethical issue that could arise in my role would be a mix between patient safety and meeting performance metrics. If I don't constantly check on our equipment, report issues, and update our tech, it could lead not only to poor management, but our busted equipment could end up harming our patients. Not only that, but could also end up giving us the wrong data and records based on our patients.</p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Issues</h2>
    <p>Two major cybersecurity threats that could occur in our business would be ransomware attacks and phishing attempts. A ransomware attack would enable an attacker to encrypt our data and demand payment for its release, and it's bad for us because we could lose access to patient records and diagnostic tools for days. Not only that, but it's distressing because with so much information gone, it could delay surgeries and endanger lives. Phishing attempts would include an attacker targeting our staff to gain access to patient data, which, of course, is bad because this is considered a breach, and can lead to identity theft.</p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
    <p>Some of the best cybersecurity practices within the healthcare industry would include using multi-factor authentication, encrypting patient records, conducting regular security audits, and training staff on being able to recognize cyber threats. Although there are plenty more ways to protect a hospital's/clinic database, these are the top practices that should overall keep a database safe.</p>
